# Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm a passionate Android developer üíö and a huge Kotlin enthusiastüíú. I also have a very keen interest in software architecture üë∑üèª. I was primarily a Java developer until I got to taste Kotlin.  I became an ardent fan of Kotlin the day I wrote the first line of Kotlin code. I have 2 years of experience using Kotlin. Recently I got really interested into CI and automating CI workflows ü§ñ. I am also a big fan of IDE‚Äôs built by Jetbrains and I‚Äôve been working with IntelliJ and Android Studio for more than three years. I also have experience working with Firebase Authentication,Cloud Firestore and Firebase storage.

- üíõ Tools and Technologies I love : Kotlin, Jetpack compose, Coroutines , Github Actions
- üéº I‚Äôm currently working on a music player app.
- üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm currently learning about CI and automating CI workflows with Github actions.
- üòÑ Pronouns : he/his
- üéæ Fun fact : Besides programming, I also really like to play tennis.
- üìñ Blogs : I recently started writing technical blog posts. You can check theme out from [here](https://medium.com/@theAndroidDeveloper).
